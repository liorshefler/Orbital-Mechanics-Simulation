# Orbital Mechanics Simulation

## Description
This program simulates the orbital motion of a celestial body around a central mass using numerical integration. The animation of the orbit is displayed within a Jupyter Notebook.

## Installation
To run this program, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary dependencies. Follow the steps below to set up your environment.

### 1. Install Python
Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 2. Install Dependencies

```
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy ipython ipywidgets notebook
```

## Running the Program
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open the provided notebook file and execute the cells to visualize the orbit animation.

## Troubleshooting
- If animations do not display properly, ensure `matplotlib` is installed and running in an interactive environment.
- If `jupyter notebook` command is not found, try reinstalling Jupyter with:
  ```
  pip install --upgrade notebook
  ```
